## Project Title

E-Commerce Back End

## Description


Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

## Installation Instructions

You will need node.js installed 
* [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
* Use the[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the 
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
* After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.
* Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.



To install the required dependencies, please run the following command:

```
npm i mysql2
npm i sequelizer

```
